Drivers
-------

You can download the latest firmware from
`the manufacturer's website <https://www.pioneerdj.com/en/support/software/controller/ddj-400/>`__.

Unfortunately Pioneer offers no Linux support, so to update your controller's
firmware you will need access to a Windows or Mac machine. Simply download the
drivers, attach your device and run the installer.

.. note:: It is highlty recommended that you update your controller's firmware.
          This will fix a bug in the release drivers which causes the tempo
          sliders to send signals without being touched!
