Controllers
***********

Mixxx ships with a number built-in :term:`MIDI` or :term:`HID` mappings, so the following controllers are supported out of the box.

Third-party controller mappings that were contributed by the community but are not yet included in Mixxx can be found at Mixxx'
`Controller Mapping Forum <https://mixxx.discourse.group/c/controller-mappings/10>`__ and the
`Wiki <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki>`__.
