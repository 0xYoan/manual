By default, the input channels 1-2 use the RCA phono inputs for the
source signal. On Windows, this can be switched to the microphone in the
ASIO driver control panel. On GNU/Linux and Mac OS X, [a particular MIDI
message must be sent](http://mixxx.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=8380)
to switch channels 1-2 to the microphone input.
