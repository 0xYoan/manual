| IMHO the U-Mix Control Pro 2 offers an unbeatable value for its low price, which matches most of the professional DJ-Needs. It’s a MIDI DJ controller with an **internal soundcard** and **two
  Inputs** for Turntables or any Audio-Source with RCA. This controller is perfect for DJs seeking a mobile, compact, sturdy DJing solution. It offers also a **changeable** Cross-fader, **adjustable**
  Cross-Fader **Curve** and **individual Touch-Level-Sensors**, which are normally only seen at triple-priced devices.
| The U-Mix Control **Pro** differs only in Cue-Button-Labels. The U-Mix Control 2 (without “Pro” = internal soundcard) also. Both should work fine with this MIDI mapping.
