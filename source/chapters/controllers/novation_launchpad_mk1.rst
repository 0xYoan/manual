-  `Forum thread <http://mixxx.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=3739>`__

This device is not USB MIDI class compliant. Its signals are translated to MIDI by special drivers on Windows and Mac OS X. There is no driver available for Linux. It has been discontinued in favor of
the `Novation Launchpad Mk2 <Novation%20Launchpad%20Mk2>`__ which is USB MIDI class compliant and has RGB pads.
