Packages of Mixxx are only offered for Ubuntu Linux. Your distribution may
maintain a non-official build that you may use. Alternatively, you can build
Mixxx from source. This should not be a terrible process, and it's certainly
easiest on GNU/Linux. For more information, see the `Compiling on Linux
<http://mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/compiling_on_linux>`_ section of the `Mixxx Wiki
<http://mixxx.org/wiki>`_.


Building Mixxx from Source
--------------------------

If your operating system isn't on this list, then it's likely you're going to
have to build Mixxx from the source code. For more information, you should
probably head over to the `Mixxx Wiki <http://mixxx.org/wiki>`_.
