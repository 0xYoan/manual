Vinyl control allows a user to manipulate the playback of a track in Mixxx using
a real turntable as a controller. In effect, it simulates the sound and feel of
having your digital music collection on vinyl. Many DJs prefer the tactile feel
of vinyl, and vinyl control allows that feel to be preserved while retaining the
benefits of using digital audio.

How does it work?
=================

Vinyl control uses special :term:`timecode` records or CD's which are placed on
real turntables or :term:`CDJ`. The audio output of the turntables is plugged
into a computer on which Mixxx is running. When a record is played on one of the
attached turntables, Mixxx reads the timecode from the record and uses the
information to manipulate whatever track is loaded.

What do I need to use it?
=========================

It is possible to use Mixxx's vinyl control with several hardware setups, but
the basic ones are:

**Setup 1: Vinyl DJ**

  Two timecode vinyls, two turntables with phono pre-amplifiers (or line-level
  output), and two stereo sound inputs.

  Your sound card inputs must match the turntable outputs.  Older turntables only
  have phono-level outputs, and you should find a sound card that has a phono
  pre-amplifier built in.  Some turntables have line-level output, and these can
  be used with any sound card.

  You can try skipping the phono pre-amps if you use the software pre-amp in
  Mixxx on the Vinyl Control preferences pane. This may not work for everyone.
  Line-level signals are preferred and recommended.

  For turntables a typical setup is depicted in the figure below.  First,
  connect the RCA cables from the turntables to the inputs on your sound card.
  Second, connect the outputs of your sound card to the inputs on your mixer.

.. note:: Many modern turntables have a *Line/Phono* select switch.  If yours
          does, make sure it matches the input or switch setting on your sound
          card.

**Setup 2: CDJ**

  Two timecode CDs, two CD decks, and two stereo sound inputs.

  Setting up CDJs for use with timecode CDs is similar to setting up
  turntables. The figure below outlines a typical configuration. First,
  connect the RCA cables of the CDJs to inputs of your sound card. Second,
  connect the inputs of your mixer to the outputs of your sound card. Make sure
  the input mode of your sound card is set to *Line*.

**Sound inputs**

* It is recommended to use a proper DJ sound card that has **multiple** stereo
  line inputs on it.
* Alternatively you can use two sound cards, each with a single stereo line in,
  but this is strongly discouraged.

Mixxx supports vinyl control input through a single soundcard with at least
4-channels of input (two stereo line-in jacks), or through two separate
soundcards which each have 2-channels of input (a single stereo line-in jack).
Vinyl control requires the use of stereo line-in jacks - Mono or microphone
inputs will not work.

It is strongly recommended to use a soundcard that comes with native low latency
drivers such as ASIO (Windows) or CoreAudio (Mac). Linux users depend on the
quality of the corresponding open source driver.

.. note:: For best scratch performance with vinyl control, we recommend using a
          system capable of :term:`latencies <latency>` of 10ms. With higher
          latencies the scratch sound will start to become distorted.

Supported Timecode media
------------------------

You can use any of the timecode media supported by Mixxx:

+----------------------------------------+---------------------+
| Type                                   | Responsiveness      |
+========================================+=====================+
| Serato CV02 Vinyl                      | Very high           |
+----------------------------------------+---------------------+
| Serato CV02 CD                         | Very high           |
+----------------------------------------+---------------------+
| Traktor Scratch MK1 Vinyl              | Very high           |
+----------------------------------------+---------------------+
| Traktor Scratch MK2 Vinyl              | Not supported       |
+----------------------------------------+---------------------+
| MixVibes DVS V2 Vinyl                  | Very high           |
+----------------------------------------+---------------------+

At the present time, Serato records are recommended if you are looking to buy
vinyl. If you want to use CDs, you can download a free copy for personal use
from `Serato`_.

You can configure vinyl control in
:menuselection:`Preferences --> Vinyl Control`.

Turntable Input Preamp
----------------------

Many turntables provide unamplified “phono level” output which must be boosted
to a “line level” signal. Normally, a mixer or soundcard provides this
amplification, but if you're plugging a turntable's phono output directly into
a soundcard that doesn't support phono input, Mixxx can do the amplification.
The :guilabel:`Turntable Input Preamp` slider allows you to adjust the level of
preamplification applied to your decks' signal. However it is always preferable
to use a proper phono preamplifier if you have one.

Vinyl Configuration
-------------------

* **Vinyl Type**: Several types of timecoded media can be used to control Mixxx.
  Configure the drop-down menus to match what type of timecoded media you are
  using on your decks.
* **Deck Vinyl Tempo**: Change this if you prefer to scratch with your
  turntable or CDJ set at 45 RPM, default is 33 RPM.
* **Lead-in Time**: Allows you to set a dead-zone at the start of your vinyl or
  CD, where the time code will be ignored. This is useful in situations where
  the time code begins very close to the edge of a vinyl which can make
  back-cueing over the first beat in a track tricky to do without your turntable's
  needle falling off the vinyl. Setting a lead-in time of 20 seconds or more
  helps alleviate this by giving you more room on the vinyl to cue with. It's
  also useful when you've worn the grooves at the edge of a control record to
  the point that it no longer works reliably: you simply set the lead-in so that
  the start of the tracks begin in good groove area. You can keep doing this
  until you run out of groove area, thereby decreasing your record replacement
  frequency.
* **Show Signal Quality in Skins**: If enabled, a circular representation of the
  incoming timecode signal is displayed in real-time on the
  :ref:`Vinyl Widget <interface-button-grid>` in the Mixxx Interface.

.. hint:: Although not recommended, you can use different kinds of timecode
          media per deck.

.. _vinyl-control-modes:

Control Mode
------------

Mixxx has three control modes regardless of which control records you use.

* **Absolute Mode**: Provides Mixxx with both pitch and position information
  from the timecode, and allows you to seek by needle dropping on your vinyl or
  seeking on your CDJ.
* **Relative Mode**: Takes the position to be relative to your deck's starting
  point, and only controls the pitch in Mixxx. It is not possible to seek using
  your deck in relative mode, with one exception. If you drop the needle in the
  :guilabel:`Lead-in Time` area (see `Vinyl Configuration`_), Mixxx will seek
  back to the beginning of the track.  Once a track is playing in Relative Mode,
  Mixxx will not allow you to select Absolute mode. Otherwise, the track would
  suddenly jump to a new position. Make sure the record is stopped and then
  you're free to select Absolute mode.
* **Constant Mode**: This special mode is usually only activated when Mixxx
  needs to keep playing a track even if the vinyl control signal isn't present.
  Constant mode is automatically enabled when the needle reaches the end of a
  vinyl control record.

Cueing Modes
------------

Mixxx has two optional cueing modes for vinyl control which **only** apply to
**Relative Mode**. These modes are useful for quickly seeking to specific
positions in a track without touching the laptop. Turntablists often need to
find a break or a vocal sample, and cueing modes make these easy to find.

* **Cue**: In this mode, when you drop the needle on the record *after* the
  Cue point, Mixxx will seek to that cue point.
* **Hot Cue**: When the needle is dropped Mixxx will seek to the nearest hotcue
  point, working backwards. So if you have a hotcue at the one-minute mark, and
  another at the two-minute mark, you can drop the needle anywhere between one
  and two minutes and Mixxx will seek to the one-minute hotcue.

.. hint:: You can change the Control and Cueing Modes directly in the Mixxx user
          interface while mixing, go to :ref:`interface-vc-mode`. Alternatively,
          use the :ref:`appendix-shortcuts`.

.. _vinyl-control-signal-quality:

Signal Quality
--------------

A successful vinyl control setup hinges on good signal quality. Many factors can
affect signal quality, but the most important one is ensuring the volume level
of your timecode signal is moderate. A signal that is too loud or too quiet will
cause adverse performance, often characterized by a loss of position data
causing absolute mode to behave like relative mode.

Mixxx represents your timecode signal quality as a circular representation of
the vinyl control audio signal itself. The two graphs correspond to your
:guilabel:`Deck 1` and :guilabel:`Deck 2` input devices.

If your vinyl signal is working, you should see a round, green circle drawn with
two lines. This vinyl “doughnut” should be as circular as possible, and the
lines should be clear with a minimum amount of fuzz.

.. hint:: You can display the signal quality in the Mixxx user interface while
          mixing, see :ref:`vinyl-control-config` .

Enabling Vinyl Control
======================

For each deck, select :menuselection:`Options --> Vinyl Control -->
Enable Vinyl Control`, or use the :ref:`appendix-shortcuts`.

Vinyl Control Status Display

A rectangle provides visual feedback with regards to vinyl control status of a
deck.

* **Off**: Vinyl control disabled on the deck.
* **Green**: Vinyl control is enabled on the deck.
* **Yellow**: The needle has reached End-Of-Record.

Single Deck Control
===================

If you only have one turntable, you can still use Mixxx to play your sets. In
the :menuselection:`Preferences --> Sound Hardware --> Input` tab, use the same
audio input for both :guilabel:`Vinyl Control` decks.

When mixing, you'll have one track playing automatically while the other is
controlled by the turntable. Start by enabling vinyl control on the first deck,
and start mixing. When you're ready to cue up the next record, just disable
vinyl control on the first deck and enable it on the second deck. Playback
will continue on the first deck without interruption. Cue up the second track
and mix it in. When you're ready to cue the first deck again, just toggle the
second deck off and the first deck on again.

Use the :ref:`appendix-shortcuts` to swap focus from one deck to the other.
Alternatively, select :menuselection:`Vinyl --> Single Deck mode` in the
:ref:`advanced-controller-wizard`, to assign the control to a key on your
controller.

End-Of-Record Mode
==================

Sometimes the track you are playing is longer than the timecode area on your
record. If the needle reaches the end of the vinyl timecode, Mixxx will enter
a special *End-Of-Record Mode*. When this happens, the vinyl indicator (usually
a green rectangle) will blink yellow as a warning. At the same time, Mixxx will
automatically enable *Constant Mode* and will ignore the turntable's pitch. At
this point the track will simply continue playing until the end. When you load
a new track, *End-Of-Record Mode* will be automatically disabled and
*Constant Mode* turned off.

When you're in *End-Of-Record Mode* and you want to still use the turntable for
pitch control, simply lift the needle and place it anywhere in the main timecode
area. It's OK, the track won't stop playing. As soon as Mixxx detects that the
needle has settled, it will automatically switch to *Relative Mode*.

Control Track
=============

Some vinyl control records have a special portion of grooves near the center
of the record for selecting and loading tracks in the user interface. You can
see these grooves because there is a gap between the main timecode area and the
inner circle. Some control records have not been tested with Mixxx, and their
control areas are not supported. Serato CV02 Vinyl and Traktor Vinyl MK1 are
known to work. Serato CV02 CDs are known not to work.

Just drop the needle in the control area and let the record play forward or
backward. The highlighted row in the library should move up or down. Simply
lift the needle and drop it anywhere in the main timecode area to load the
track.

Troubleshooting
===============

**Configuration**

To complete your setup you must configure Mixxx properly. Make sure you have:

* specified :guilabel:`Deck 1` and :guilabel:`Deck 2` in
  :menuselection:`Preferences --> Sound Hardware` to
  route Mixxx's output directly to the external mixer
* specified :guilabel:`Vinyl Control 1` and :guilabel:`Vinyl Control 2` under
  :menuselection:`Preferences --> Sound Hardware --> Input`
* selected the correct control type under
  :menuselection:`Preferences --> Vinyl Control --> Vinyl type` in the
  preferences. See :ref:`control-timecode` for the list of supported control
  records/CDs.
* enabled vinyl control via the menu under
  :menuselection:`Options -> Vinyl Control --> Enable Vinyl Control`.
