Configuring your Setup
**********************

In this chapter we'll go over some of the most common hardware setups that you
will choose from when preparing your DJ setup with Mixxx. We cover a couple of
options varying from no hardware at all, to having vinyl turntables.

Audio Output with Mixxx
=======================

The first step to getting a proper DJ setup is figuring out how you're going to
play and :term:`cue <cueing>` audio.


In order to cue with your computer, you will need **at least 2 separate audio
outputs**. Traditionally, a headphone jack on most laptops **is not a second
audio output**. Rather, plugging headphones into the headphone jack on most
laptops allows you to listen to the main output of your laptop in your
headphones. **Having a headphone jack alone will not allow you to cue.**
