Contributing to the Project
***************************

Mixxx is a community-driven project involving many DJs worldwide. Without the
contributions from these DJs, Mixxx would not exist, and we're constantly
looking for more contributors.

If you're interested in getting involved with Mixxx, send our `Developer's
Mailing List <http://www.mixxx.org/support.php>`_ an email or hop on our
:term:`IRC` channel (`#mixxx on Freenode <http://www.mixxx.org/support.php>`_).

If you're interested in contributing code (C++):

* Take a look at our specs/projects page on the Mixxx Wiki and see if anything
  catches your eye. If you want to start coding one of these, go right ahead!
* We're always willing to mentor and help out new coders
* Take a look at our bug tracker, try to fix a bug!
* Send patches to mixxx-devel or post them as bugs on Launchpad!

If you're not interested in coding, there are still many ways to help our project:

* Test beta and trunk versions of Mixxx to make sure new features and fixes work
  well in all cases.
* Create mappings for MIDI controllers Mixxx doesn't yet support. (Advanced
  functionality requires some Javascript-like programming.)
* Help answer questions in the `Mixxx forums <http://mixxx.org/forums>`_.
* Help document Mixxx on the `Mixxx wiki <http://mixxx.org/wiki>`_.
* Help promote Mixxx: If you've got a blog, write an article about Mixxx. Blog
  about our new releases when they come out. Any exposure on the web and in
  print helps our project grow, and is much appreciated.
* Send us some photos of you using Mixxx at a gig!
