An Overview of the Mixxx Interface
**********************************

Welcome to the Mixxx interface. This is where the magic happens.
You are going to want to get very familiar with this interface because it is
the main way to use Mixxx. In this chapter, we present the default interface of Mixxx
and describe its elements, knobs and faders.

This is the Deere skin. It is the default skin supplied with Mixxx. There are a
variety of others skins included with Mixxx. You should explore them all to
figure out which one you prefer. This section will focus on Deere only.

The Deck Sections
=================


The :term:`deck` section allows you to control everything relating to a virtual
turntable deck. We are going to break this down into sections.

Track Information
-----------------


The name of the loaded track is shown on top of each deck. Below from left to right, the
first number is the total elapsed time in the track. The second number is the
duration of the track. The third number is the track's detected :term:`BPM`. On
the far right is the rate of the track relative to its normal speed. The rate is
currently at 0.00, which means that it is playing at its normal playback rate.

Playback and Rate Controls

Loop Controls and Hotcues
-------------------------

For each deck, you can control loops, hotcues and the playback speed.
On the far left, you can :term:`fast-rewind`, :term:`reverse`, or
:term:`fast-forward` the deck, respectively. The :term:`in <loop in>` and
:term:`out <loop out>` buttons allow you to set the loop-in and loop-out
point. Tapping the :term:`loop <reloop>` button toggles whether the loop is
active or not.

The hotcue section, the 4 colored numbers, are used to set and clear
hotcues. Clicking on a numbered button will set a hotcue. A marker with the
corresponding number will appear in the waveform with the same number as the
button and the button will turn red to indicate that the hotcue is set. If the
deck is playing, you can simply tap a hotcue to cause the deck to instantly jump
back to the location of the hotcue. To clear a hotcue, right-click on the
numbered button.

The Waveform
------------

The waveform section of a deck allows you to visualize the
audio changes that occur throughout the track. The larger, zoomed-in waveform is
called the :term:`waveform overview`, while the smaller, zoomed-out version of
the waveform is called the :term:`waveform summary`. The white lines on the
waveform overview are called :term:`beat markers`, and they indicate the
locations of beats in the audio. The vertical line in the center of the waveform
overview indicates the playback point of the deck.

The two buttons at the bottom right of this section are the :term:`repeat` and
:term:`key lock` buttons. Clicking the repeat button causes the track to repeat
once reaches its end. Clicking the keylock button enabes :term:`key lock` mode.
