   cueing
     Headphone cueing, or just cueing, is listening to the next track you would
     like to mix in in your headphones. The audience will not hear what you are
     cueing in your headphones. Being able to cue is a crucial aspect to DJing.

   crossfader
     The crossfader is a slider that determines how much each deck of audio
     contributes to the :term:`master output`.

   master output
     The master output is the main audio output. It's what your audience hears.

   headphone output
     The headphone output is what you hear in your headphones. You can play tracks to

   PFL
     ``PFL`` or "pre-fader listen" is a fancy word for whether or not you are
     "pre-listening" to a deck in your headphones. See also: :term:`headphone button`.

   waveform summary
     The waveform summary shows the waveform envelope of the track near the current playback postition.

   waveform overview
     The waveform overview shows the waveform envelope of the entire track, and is
     useful because they allow DJs to see breakdowns far in advance.

   key lock
     With key lock enabled, the tempo of the track will change but the pitch
     remains consistent.  When unlocked, the pitch slider will speed up (or slow
     down) the track and the pitch will increase (or decrease) along with it.

   headphone button
     The headphone button is used to indicate whether or not you are
     pre-listening to a deck or sampler in your headphones.

   operating system
     Your operating system (OS) is the computing environment on your
     computer. For example, Windows, Mac OS X, or GNU/Linux are the three
     operating systems that Mixxx supports.

   head/mix button
     The head/mix button is used to control how much you mix the :term:`master
     output` into your :term:`headphone output`. This can be very useful when
     :term:`cueing` a track, because you can test out how it sounds when mixed
     with the main mix in your headphones, before letting the audience hear the
     track.

   track
     A track is another word for a song.

   deck
     A deck is like a virtual vinyl turntable. You can load a :term:`track` into
     it and play the track, just like you would put a record on turntable and
     play it.

   IRC
     Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a an online chat network. The Mixxx IRC
     channel can be found on the `FreeNode IRC Network <http://freenode.net>`_
     in the #mixxx channel.

   BPM
     Beats per minute (BPM) is used as a measure of tempo in music.
     If you tap your foot to music you are following the “beat”.
     If you count how many taps you do in a minute you have calculated the BPM.

   Beatmatching
     A mixing technique used to establish a similar tempo with two or more tracks,
     making them sound like just one track.

   MIDI Controller
     An external hardware device, usually connected to your computer via USB,
     that allows you to control audio applications. Many DJs prefer to control
     DJ software using physical knobs, faders, and wheels instead of using a
     keyboard.

   Vinyl Control
     A method of controlling DJ applications which simulates the traditional
     DJing paradigm of two turntables. Using special vinyl records called
     "timecode records", the DJ application analyzes the timecode signal and
     simulates the sound and feel of having your music collection on vinyl.

   Sync
     Sync allows you to automatically adjust the sync'd track to be in sync with
     another deck that is playing.

   Rate
     The speed at which a track is played back, usually expressed in terms of a
     percentage of the speed relative to the tracks normal rate. Often while
     mixing, DJs adjust the rates of tracks so that they can play at the same
     tempo as other tracks. This allows DJs to beatmix, and is an essential part
     of DJing.

   Phase
     The phase of a track is its position relative to another track. If two
     tracks are sync'd to the same tempo and in-phase then they should be
     playing so that their beats are aligned.

   Pitch bend
     A technique used by DJs that temporarily `bends` the rate of a track up or
     down, usually while a button is held. This technique is usually used to
     make micro-adjustments to the synchronization of tracks while
     beatmatching. Before digital DJing, this was accomplished by dragging one's
     finger alongside the turntable to slow it down or by twisting the record
     spindle to speed it up.
