   cueing
     Headphone cueing, or just cueing, is listening to the next track you would
     like to mix in in your headphones. The audience will not hear what you are
     cueing in your headphones. Being able to cue is a crucial aspect to DJing.

   crossfader
     The crossfader is a slider that determines how much each deck of audio
     contributes to the :term:`master output`.

   master output
     The master output is the main audio output. It is what your audience hears.

   headphone output
     The headphone output is what you hear in your headphones.

   PFL
     ``PFL`` or "pre-fader listen" is a fancy word for whether or not you are
     "pre-listening" to a deck in your headphones. See also:
     :term:`headphone button`.

   waveform summary
     The waveform summary shows the waveform envelope of the track near the
     current playback postition.

   waveform overview
     The waveform overview shows the waveform envelope of the entire track, and
     is useful because they allow DJs to see breakdowns far in advance.

   key lock
     With key lock enabled, the tempo of the track will change but the pitch
     remains consistent.  When unlocked, the pitch slider will speed up (or slow
     down) the track and the pitch will increase (or decrease) along with it.

   headphone button
     The headphone button is used to indicate whether or not you are
     pre-listening to a deck or sampler in your headphones.

   operating system
     Your operating system (OS) is the computing environment on your
     computer. For example, Windows, Mac OS X, or GNU/Linux are the three
     operating systems that Mixxx supports.

   file manager
     Is a computer program that organizes data files into groups and shows you
     where they are when you need to find them again. Popular file managers for
     the :term:`operating systems <operating system>` Mixxx supports are
     Explorer on Windows, Finder on Mac OS X and Nautilus on GNU/Linux.

   head/mix button
     The head/mix button is used to control how much you mix the :term:`master
     output` into your :term:`headphone output`. This can be very useful when
     :term:`cueing` a track, because you can test out how it sounds when mixed
     with the main mix in your headphones, before letting the audience hear the
     track.

   track
     A track is another word for a song.

   deck
     A deck is like a virtual vinyl turntable. You can load a :term:`track` into
     it and play the track, just like you would put a record on turntable and
     play it.

   IRC
     Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a an online chat network. The Mixxx IRC
     channel can be found on the `FreeNode IRC Network <http://freenode.net>`_
     in the #mixxx channel.

   BPM
     Beats per minute (BPM) is used as a measure of tempo in music.
     If you tap your foot to music you are following the “beat”.
     If you count how many taps you do in a minute you have calculated the BPM.

   beatmatching
     A mixing technique used to establish a similar tempo with two or more tracks,
     making them sound like just one track.

   beatgrid
     A series of markers that point to the location of beats within the track.
     Beatgrids are used for advanced mixing functions such as track sync,
     precise effects synchronization, looping and accurate :term:`BPM`
     representation.

   MIDI
     Short for for Musical Instrument Digital Interface. A digital
     communications language and hardware specification enabling compatible
     electronic instruments, sequencers, computers, etc., to communicate with
     each other in a network.

   HID
     Short for for Human Interface Device, a part of the USB specification. It
     specifies a device class (a type of computer hardware) for human interface
     devices such as keyboards, mice and game controllers.

   MIDI controller
     An external hardware device that generates and transmits :term:`MIDI` data
     to MIDI-enabled hardware or software (e.g. Mixxx). Usually connected to
     your computer via USB, MIDI controllers allows you to control audio
     applications among others. Many DJs prefer to control DJ software using
     physical knobs, faders, and wheels instead of using a computer keyboard.

   HID controller
     An external hardware device that generates and transmits :term:`HID` data
     to HID-enabled hardware or software (e.g. Mixxx). Connected to your
     computer via USB, HID controllers allows you to control audio
     applications among others. Many DJs prefer to control DJ software using
     physical knobs, faders, and wheels instead of using a computer keyboard.
     Besides the known DJ controllers also keyboards, mice and game controllers
     are some of the most popular HID devices. Compared to :term:`MIDI` it
     also allows to use of advanced features like found on modern :term:`CDJ`,
     e.g. display screens and high-resolution jogwheels.

   vinyl control
     A method of controlling DJ applications which simulates the traditional
     DJing paradigm of two turntables. Using special :term:`timecode` media,
     the DJ application analyzes the timecode signal and simulates the sound and
     feel of having your music collection on vinyl.

   timecode
     Used here in conjunction with :term:`vinyl control`. A special audio signal
     on a control vinyl or control CD (timecode media) that a computer can
     listen to in order to determine speed, direction and position of the
     playback.

   sync
     Sync allows you to automatically adjust the sync'd tracks :term:`tempo`
     and :term:`phase` to be in sync with another deck that is playing.

   rate
     The speed at which a track is played back, usually expressed in terms of a
     percentage of the speed relative to the tracks normal rate. Often while
     mixing, DJs adjust the rates of tracks so that they can play at the same
     tempo as other tracks. This allows DJs to beatmix, and is an essential part
     of DJing.

   fast-forward
     It means to cause something to advance at quicker than normal speed. In
     terms of audio software that means if you press the fast forward button
     the audio will play with increased speed as long as the button is pressed.
     This is useful to seek trough a track.

   fast-rewind
     The opposite of :term:`fast-forward`. If you press the fast rewind button
     the audio will play in reverse with increased speed as long as the button
     is pressed.

   phase
     The phase of a track is its position relative to another track. If two
     tracks are sync'd to the same tempo and in-phase then they should be
     playing so that their beats are aligned.

   pitch bend
     A technique used by DJs that temporarily `bends` the rate of a track up or
     down, usually while a button is held. This technique is usually used to
     make micro-adjustments to the synchronization of tracks while
     beatmatching. Before digital DJing, this was accomplished by dragging one's
     finger alongside the turntable to slow it down or by twisting the record
     spindle to speed it up.

   ramping pitch bend
     Basically identical to the regular :term:`pitch bend` with the difference
     that the pitch changes gradually, instead of all at once. Often uses for
     temporary pitch changes. It simulates the effect of touching a turntable
     to temporary slow down or speed up a record.

   latency
     Latency refers to a short period of delay (usually measured in milliseconds)
     between when an audio signal enters and when it emerges from a system.
     Being able to lower the Latency as much as possible makes a huge difference
     in responsiveness.

   kill switch
     A button to turn on and off output or individual frequency ranges within a
     channel, i.e. treble, mid and bass. Useful for effects where the DJ drops
     a track out for a period or creates room for a transition.

   vu meter
     The volume unit (VU) meter is used to show the relative levels of audio
     signals and is subdivided across channels. Basically it represents how
     'loud' a sound from a channel is.

   balance
     A balance control on a mixer allows to adjust the balance between the left
     and right channel. The balance refers to the relative volume of the
     corresponding channel in a stereo audio signal.

   tempo
     The speed of a track measured in :term:`bpm`.

   volume
     A term that refers to the degree of sound intensity or audibility; loudness.
     A volume control is used to adjust the output gain setting.

   reverse
     Reverse plays a track backwards.

   Ogg Vorbis
     A patent-free lossy audio compression algorithm which uses a form of lossy
     data compression. It is designed to provide for efficient streaming and
     manipulation of high quality digital audio. Ogg Vorbis files generally end
     with a .OGG or .OGA extension.

   MP3
     A patented lossy audio compression algorithm which uses a form of lossy
     data compression. It is de facto standard of digital audio compression for
     music. MP3 files generally end with a .MP3 extension.

   AAC
     Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) is a patented lossy audio compression algorithm
     which uses a form of lossy data compression. Designed to be the successor
     :term:`MP3`, AAC generally achieves better sound quality at similar bit
     rates. While the .AAC extension is sometimes used for AAC-encoded files,
     they are typically saved with an .M4A file extension.

   FLAC
     Free Lossless Audio Compression (FLAC), a patent-free audio compression
     similar to :term:`MP3` but lossless. Lossless because when audio files are
     compressed using FLAC there is no loss in quality. FLAC files generally end
     with a .FLAC extension.

   AIFF
     Short for Audio Interchange File Format. High-quality digital audio file
     format, similar to .wav files. Contains CD-quality audio stored in a
     non-compressed, lossless format. AIFF files generally end with a .AIFF or
     .AIF extension.

   WAV
     Standard digital audio file format used for storing waveform data; allows
     audio recordings to be saved with different sampling rates and bitrates;
     often saved in a 44.1 KHz, 16-bit, stereo format, which is the standard
     format used for CD audio. Wave files generally end with a .WAV extension.

   DRM
     Digital Rights Management (DRM) technologies attempt to control what you
     can and can't do with the media and hardware you've purchased. Typically,
     a DRM system either encrypting the data so that it can only be accessed in
     a way authorized by copyright holders or marks content with a digital
     watermark or similar method so that the content can not be freely
     distributed.

   codec
     Short for compressor/decompressor, a codec is any technology for
     compressing and decompressing audio and video data. Some popular
     codecs for computer audio include :term:`MP3` and :term:`Ogg Vorbis`.

   LAME
     LAME is a free software :term:`codec` used to encode/compress audio into
     the lossy :term:`MP3` file format.

   bitrate
     Describe the quality of an audio or video file. For audio data the bitrate
     is commonly measured :term:`Kbps`. For example, an MP3 audio file that is
     compressed at 192 Kbps will have a greater dynamic range and may sound
     slightly more clear than the same audio file compressed at 128 Kbps.

   kbps
    Short for kilobits per second. Here used to measure the quality of audio
    data. See :term:`bitrate`

   ReplayGain
    ReplayGain normalizes audio data in a non-destructive way, so the tracks in
    your music library dont all play at different volume. Audio files are
    scanned by an psychoacoustic algorithm to determine the loudness of the
    audio data. ReplayGain information is stored as metadata in a digital audio
    file in order for the sound to be correctly played at the right level of
    loudness.

   db
    Short for decibels. A Decibel is a measurement of sound level. Whispering
    is around 25 dB while unbearable sound like an starting aircraft is around
    160 db. Rule of thumb: An increase of the volume by 10 dB is perceived as
    twice as loud.

   cue sheet
    A cue sheet (or CUE file, CUE sheet, etc.) is a formatted plain text file
    which is used to provide index information for a large audio file. For
    example, it can be used to tell software extra details about the layout of a
    CD to burn.

   metadata
    It allows information such as the title, artist, album, track number, and
    other information about the file to be stored in the audio file itself, see
    `<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3>`_ . Mixxx stores additional metadata
    about a file in it's database, like :term:`beatgrid`, waveform data,
    :term:`hotcues <hotcue>`, playlists, crates, number of plays, etc. .

   CDJ
     CDJ is a term used originally to describe a line of CD players from Pioneer
     Electronics. Today CDJ is generally use for DJ CD players that works like a
     record player. They allow analog control of music from CDs, usually using
     an touch sensitive emulated vinyl control surface.

   OpenGL
     It's a way to draw stuff in 3D and is used in Mixxx for drawing the
     waveform display. OpenGL serves as a interpreter for graphics cards where
     the 3D computation happens.

   bug report
     Every software has bugs. When you come across a bug in this software, you
     should submit a report about it to the developer. They can use this to
     identify, replicate and fix the issue.

   binaries
     Files that contain compiled computer code, which was compiled from source
     code. Source code, which is usually a bunch o text files, must be feed to a
     compiler. Compiling then generates a binary, which is something like an an
     exe or a .dll file. So by using binaries you are relieved of the task of
     having to compile the code by yourself.

   soundcard
     Also known as an audio card. Is an internal computer expansion card or
     external expansion device that facilitates the input and output of audio
     signals to and from a computer under control of computer programs. Today
     DJ-soundcard are usually connected via USB and have at least 2 stereo audio
     outputs to support :term:`cueing`.

   cue
     A Cue or Cue point is a reference point in the track usually placed on the
     position the DJ wants the track to start by default. This is useful to
     instantly jump to that point without seeking through the track.

   hotcue
     Similar to the main :term:`cue` point, a Hotcue is a reference point in the
     track. DJs usually place these hotcues at distinctive positions within a
     track such as drops, breaks or kicks and snares. Mixxx allows to have up to
     36 hotcues.

   bar
     In musical notation, a bar (or measure) is a segment of time defined by a
     given number of beats, each of which are assigned a particular note value.
     Typically, a piece consists of several bars of the same length.

   flanger
     A flanger is an effect that mixes the input signal with a delayed copy of
     itself which leads to interferences in the signal and creates a comb-filter
     like effect. By routing the output of the effect back into the input
     (feedback), this effect can be enhanced.

   podcast
     A podcast is a feed of audio or video files made available for free or for
     purchase over the Internet. Podcast clients such as iTunes allow listeners
     to subscribe to the feed and automatically download content to their
     portable audio players as it becomes available.

   url
     (Uniform Resource Locator) The address that defines the route to a file on
     an Internet server. URLs are typed into a Web browser to access Web pages
     and files, and URLs are embedded within the pages themselves as hypertext
     links. One example of URLs is `<http://www.mixxx.org>`_ .

   quantization
     Quantization is the process of aligning notes and other events like loop-
     or cuepoints points so that they start or finish exact on beats or exact
     fractions of beats.
