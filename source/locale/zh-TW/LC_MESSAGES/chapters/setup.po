"Headphone cueing, or just cueing, is a crucial aspect of DJing that "
"separates DJing from merely making a playlist. Headphone cueing allows you "
"to preview the next track you would like to mix in your headphones. The "
"audience will not hear what you are cueing in your headphones until you "
"decide to mix it in."

"In order to use headphone cueing, you will need at least 2 separate audio "
"outputs, typically provided by a USB soundcard (also known as an “audio "
"interface”). The headphone jack on most laptops is not a second audio "
"output. Rather, plugging headphones into the jack simply redirects the "
"laptop's single stereo output from its speakers to your headphones. A "
"splitter cable can be used to separate the stereo output of a headphone jack"
" into two separate mono outputs for headphone cueing, but it is recommended "
"to use a sound card with at least four mono outputs (for two stereo pairs). "
"Such sound cards tend to be higher quality than those built into laptops and"
" allow your mix to be enjoyed in stereo by your audience."
