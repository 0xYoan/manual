"The audio buffer, also known as latency, is the lag time in milliseconds "
"that it takes for Mixxx to process your input (turning knobs, sliding the "
"crossfader, etc.). For example, with an audio buffer of 36 ms, it will take "
"approximately 36 milliseconds for Mixxx to stop the audio after you toggle "
"the play button. Additionally, the audio buffer setting determines how "
"quickly your :term:`Operating System` expects Mixxx to react. A smaller "
"audio buffer means Mixxx will be more responsive. On the other hand, setting"
" your audio buffer too low may be too much for your computer and sound card "
"to handle. In this situation, Mixxx playback will be choppy and very clearly"
