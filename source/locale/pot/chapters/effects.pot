msgid "The mix knob adjusts the mix between the dry signal (input to the unit) and the wet signal (output of the last effect in the unit). It changes the level of all 3 effects in the unit together. When the knob is fully left, no sound will be heard from the effect unit. When the knob is fully right, only the output of the effect unit will be heard without any of the dry input signal."

#: ../../chapters/effects.rst:52
msgid "Effects are processed after the deck faders and crossfader. This allows effects like Echo and Reverb to continue outputting sound after their input has been cut off by lowering the fader. Unlike other DJ software and hardware, effects can also be heard in headphones even though they are processed after the faders for the master output. Refer to the :ref:`effects-in-headphones` section below for details."

msgid "Note that equalizer and filter effects create a phase shift. If the mix knob is anywhere in the middle between dry and wet and any of these effects are enabled in the unit, there will be comb filtering which is probably not desired.
