msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/configuration.rst:157
msgid "The audio buffer, also known as latency, is the lag time in milliseconds that it takes for Mixxx to process your input (turning knobs, sliding the crossfader, etc.). For example, with an audio buffer of 36 ms, it will take approximately 36 milliseconds for Mixxx to stop the audio after you toggle the play button. Additionally, the audio buffer setting determines how quickly your :term:`Operating System` expects Mixxx to react. A smaller audio buffer means Mixxx will be more responsive. On the other hand, setting your audio buffer too low may be too much for your computer and sound card to handle. In this situation, Mixxx playback will be choppy and very clearly distorted as your computer will not be able to keep up with how frequently Mixxx is processing audio."

msgid "The sample rate setting in Mixxx controls how many samples per second are produced by Mixxx. This determines the maximum frequency in Mixxx's signal, which is half the sample rate. Humans can only hear up to 20 kHz, so there is generally no need to use more than a 44.1 kHz (44100 Hz) sample rate for playback. Most music is published with a 44100 Hz sample rate."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/configuration.rst:237
msgid "Most modern GNU/Linux distributions use PulseAudio by default. When launched from a GUI menu entry or icon, Mixxx suspends PulseAudio while it is running so that Mixxx can use ALSA directly. Like JACK, PulseAudio allows multiple programs to access one sound card, but PulseAudio and JACK have opposite design goals. PulseAudio is designed to make ordinary computer usage such as watching videos online and listening to music easy whereas JACK is designed for demanding low latency audio programs like Mixxx. It can be difficult to setup JACK and PulseAudio to work well together. So, unless you already use JACK, it is easiest to let Mixxx suspend PulseAudio and use ALSA."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/configuration.rst:247
msgid "If the PulseAudio plugin for alsalibs is installed on GNU/Linux, you can choose the virtual device ``pulse``. This allows Mixxx to share the default system sound card with other media players. This only works if you start Mixxx without pasuspender, which you can do by running :command:`mixxx` from a console rather than clicking the launcher icon in a menu or on your desktop. Since the sound stream is routed from ALSA to Pulse and back to ALSA, this adds an additional latency of ~2 x the selected audio buffer size."

Consequently, the beat markers are shifted, i.e. the beat markers are a fixed distance from the true beat.
