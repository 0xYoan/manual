msgid "Headphone cueing, or just cueing, is a crucial aspect of DJing that separates DJing from merely making a playlist. Headphone cueing allows you to preview the next track you would like to mix in your headphones. The audience will not hear what you are cueing in your headphones until you decide to mix it in."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/setup.rst:17
msgid "In order to use headphone cueing, you will need at least 2 separate audio outputs, typically provided by a USB soundcard (also known as an “audio interface”). The headphone jack on most laptops is not a second audio output. Rather, plugging headphones into the jack simply redirects the laptop's single stereo output from its speakers to your headphones. A splitter cable can be used to separate the stereo output of a headphone jack into two separate mono outputs for headphone cueing, but it is recommended to use a sound card with at least four mono outputs (for two stereo pairs). Such sound cards tend to be higher quality than those built into laptops and allow your mix to be enjoyed in stereo by your audience."

msgid "Unlike some proprietary DJ systems, Mixxx can use any soundcard and any :term:`MIDI` or :term:`HID` controller that your :term:`OS <operating system>` has drivers to use. Mixxx can use multiple audio devices simultaneously. Depending on your budget and application area, your sound setup and requirements may vary. This section provides useful information for club, hobby, and radio DJs alike."

With the second stereo output (channels 3-4) you can :term:`cue <cueing>` and :ref:`preview <library-previewing-tracks>` the next track in your headphones.

Mixxx can work with any :term:`MIDI` or :term:`HID` :term:`controller` as long as there is a mapping file to tell Mixxx how to understand the controller's signals. Mixxx comes bundled with a number of MIDI and HID mapping presets, which are listed in the `Mixxx DJ Hardware Guide <http://mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/hardware_compatibility>`_ on the wiki. For controllers that Mixxx does not yet support, you can `search the forum <http://mixxx.org/forums/search.php?fid[]=7>`_ to see if anyone has started a mapping. You can also start one yourself using the information in the `Controller Mapping Documentation <http://mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/start#controller_mapping_documentation>`_ on the wiki."
