msgid "Vinyl control allows a user to manipulate the playback of a track in Mixxx using a real turntable as a controller. In effect, it simulates the sound and feel of having your digital music collection on vinyl. Many DJs prefer the tactile feel of vinyl, and vinyl control allows that feel to be preserved while retaining the benefits of using digital audio."

msgid "How does it work?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/vinyl_control.rst:22
msgid "Vinyl control uses special :term:`timecode` records or CD's which are placed on real turntables or :term:`CDJ`. The audio output of the turntables is plugged into a soundcard connected to a computer on which Mixxx is running. When a record is played on one of the attached turntables, Mixxx reads the timecode from the record and uses the information to manipulate whatever track is loaded."

msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/vinyl_control.rst:36
msgid "It is possible to use Mixxx's vinyl control with a variety of setups. Unlike some proprietary DJ software, Mixxx can use several types of timecode media and any soundcard that your :term:`operating system` has drivers to use. Optionally, any :ref:`MIDI/HID controller <control-midi>` can be used together with timecode control. The basic setups for timecode control are:"

msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/vinyl_control.rst:47
msgid "Your sound card inputs must match the turntable outputs. Turntables output very quiet phono-level outputs that must be amplified for Mixxx to use. You should either find a sound card that has phono pre-amplifiers built in (one for each deck), use standalone phono pre-amplifiers, or use turntables with built in phono pre-amplifiers."

This is useful in situations where the time code begins very close to the edge of a vinyl which can make back-cueing over the first beat in a track tricky to do without your turntable's needle falling off the vinyl. Setting a lead-in time of 20 seconds or more helps alleviate this by giving you more room on the vinyl to cue with. It's also useful when you've worn the grooves at the edge of a control record to the point that it no longer works reliably: you simply set the lead-in so that the start of the tracks begin in good groove area. You can keep doing this until you run out of groove area, thereby decreasing your record replacement frequency."

msgid "**Relative Mode**: Takes the position to be relative to your deck's starting point, and only controls the pitch in Mixxx. It is not possible to seek using your deck in relative mode, with one exception. If you drop the needle in the :guilabel:`Lead-in Time` area (see `Vinyl Configuration`_), Mixxx will seek back to the beginning of the track.
