msgid "Setting Your Levels Properly (Gain Staging)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/djing_with_mixxx.rst:23
msgid "Setting your levels properly, also known as gain staging, is essential for getting the best sound quality out of the equipment you are using. At every link in your signal chain, from Mixxx's channel gains to the power amplifier, the level should be well above the noise floor, but lower than the maximum level before the signal clips. The :term:`level meters <level meter>` should mostly be around the top of their green region. The level meter pictured to the left shows where Mixxx's level meters should average at the loudest parts of tracks. The average level should not be in the yellow region. Use the yellow region to leave headroom, or available level above the average before the signal clips. The loudest parts of the music (the transients) should briefly go into the yellow region."

msgid "A waveform at a good level. Note that the example waveforms in this section were made by adjusting the visual gain of the waveform display in Mixxx to illustrate the concepts. Adjusting the visual gain of the waveform display does not change the level of the audio."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/djing_with_mixxx.rst:50
msgid "**If a level meter is in its red region, the signal is clipping and the gain should be turned down.** Some equipment doesn't have a level meter and only has an LED that turns on when the signal clips. Clipping means that the peaks of the waveform are flattened because the equipment has reached the maximum level that it can amplify the signal to. This distorts sound in an unpleasant way and can damage equipment by driving it with more power than it is designed to handle. Increasing the gain past the point where clipping begins (further into the red on a meter) will distort the signal more. If you want to make the sound louder when every part of the signal chain is at its maximum without clipping, use more speakers or use speakers that are more sensitive and convert electrical energy into acoustic energy more efficiently."

#: ../../chapters/djing_with_mixxx.rst:74
msgid "On the other hand, the signal should not be too low. This is because every audio device generates a little noise at a level referred to as its noise floor. Additionally, analog signals pick up noise as they travel along wires. The signal measured by the meter on the left is relatively close to the noise floor. When a device is turned up, the noise floor does not go up; only the signal does. However, every time the signal is amplified by the gain of another piece of equipment, both the noise and the signal from previous devices in the signal chain are amplified. For example, if your sound card is turned down and you turn the gain up on your mixer to compensate, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the sound card output will be low and the mixer's gain will amplify the signal and the noise from the sound card, plus the noise picked up along the wire. The end result will have more noise than if the output of the sound card was turned up before the signal reached the mixer and the mixer's gain did not have to be turned up."

msgid "Beatmatching and Mixing"
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/djing_with_mixxx.rst:106
msgid ":term:`Beatmatching` is the process of adjusting the playback rate of a track so that it matches the tempo of another track. Beatmatching also involves adjusting the :term:`phase` of the beats in a track so that they are aligned with the beats in the other track. Matching the :term:`tempo` and aligning the beats are the two things a DJ must do to beatmatch."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/djing_with_mixxx.rst:112
msgid "Mixxx can match the tempo and align the beats for you but this requires an accurately detected BPM value and a correct beat grid for both tracks. To enable this feature, tap the :guilabel:`SYNC` button. To beatmatch manually, the tempo of the two tracks must be synchronized by adjusting the playback rate sliders. You can adjust the phase of the beats by right-clicking and dragging on either waveform display to temporarily speed up or slow down one of the tracks until the beats are aligned. The temporary pitch bend buttons can also be used to momentarily adjust the playback rate, allowing you to “shuffle” the beats in a track forwards or backwards, so they can be aligned with another track. See the chapter :ref:`interface-rate`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/djing_with_mixxx.rst:123
msgid "Two tracks are beatmatched once their tempos are matched and their beats are aligned. A “perfect” beatmatch is nearly impossible - there will always be a tiny difference in the playback rates. A keen DJ will keep his or her ears open and listen for the beats drifting out of alignment. This has a distinct “double bass kick” sound which is often preceded by the kick weakening in intensity as the two kicks drift out of phase. When this happens, the beats can be realigned by simply tapping one of the temporary pitch bend buttons a few times in the appropriate direction."

msgid "To activate Master Sync on a deck, push and hold (or click and hold) the :guilabel:`SYNC` button. You'll know Master Sync is on because the sync button will remain lit.  Changing the rate of any deck that has Sync lit will change the rates of all other decks that also have the Sync button lit.  There is no need to set specific decks to be a master or followers.  You can play, stop, eject, load, and queue any track with master sync and it won't interrupt the playback of the other decks.  However, changing the rate of a stopped deck will change the rate of playing decks."
