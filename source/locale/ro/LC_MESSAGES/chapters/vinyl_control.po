"Vinyl control allows a user to manipulate the playback of a track in Mixxx "
"using a real turntable as a controller. In effect, it simulates the sound "
"and feel of having your digital music collection on vinyl. Many DJs prefer "
"the tactile feel of vinyl, and vinyl control allows that feel to be "
"preserved while retaining the benefits of using digital audio."

"Vinyl control uses special :term:`timecode` records or CD's which are placed"
" on real turntables or :term:`CDJ`. The audio output of the turntables is "
"plugged into a soundcard connected to a computer on which Mixxx is running. "
"When a record is played on one of the attached turntables, Mixxx reads the "
