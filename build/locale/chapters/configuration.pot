msgid "Latency is the lag time in milliseconds that it takes for Mixxx to process your input (turning knobs, sliding the crossfader, etc.). For example, a latency of 36 ms indicates that it will take approximately 36 milliseconds for Mixxx to stop the audio after you toggle the play button. Additionally, latency determines how quickly your :term:`Operating System` expects Mixxx to react. Lower latency means Mixxx will be more responsive. On the other hand, setting your latency too low may be too much for your computer to handle. In this situation, Mixxx playback will be choppy and very clearly distorted as your computer will not be able to keep up with how frequently Mixxx is processing audio."

msgid "The sample rate setting in Mixxx determines how many samples per second are produced by Mixxx. Mixxx automatically selects a default sample rate for your soundcard, most likely 44100 Hz. In general, a higher sample rate means that Mixxx produces more audio data for your soundcard. This takes more CPU time, but in theory produces higher audio quality. On high-wattage club sound systems, it may become apparent if your audio sample rate is too low."
