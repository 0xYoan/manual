msgid "**Sample Rate**: Allows you to manually select the sample rate for the audio input. The sample rate value should be set to the sample rate of your audio interface. By default, Mixxx tries the system default first, which is most likely 44.1 kHz. Otherwise, Mixxx will pick a different default."

#: ../../source/chapters/configuration.rst:84
msgid "To achieve the best performance with Mixxx it is essential to configure your *latency*, *sample rate*, and *audio API*. These three factors largely determine Mixxx's responsiveness and audio quality and the optimal settings will vary based on your computer and hardware quality."

msgid "Latency"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/chapters/configuration.rst:94
msgid "Latency is the lag time in milliseconds that it takes for Mixxx to process your input (turning knobs, sliding the crossfader, etc.). For example, a latency of 36 ms indicates that it will take approximately 36 milliseconds for Mixxx to stop the audio after you toggle the play button. Additionally, latency determines how quickly your :term:`Operating System` expects Mixxx to react. Lower latency means Mixxx will be more responsive. On the other hand, setting your latency too low may be too much for your computer to handle. In this situation, Mixxx playback will be choppy and very clearly distorted as your computer will not be able to keep up with how frequently Mixxx is processing audio."

#: ../../source/chapters/configuration.rst:105
msgid "A latency between 36-64 ms is acceptable if you are using Mixxx with a keyboard/mouse or a MIDI controller. A latency below 10 ms is recommended when vinyl control is used because Mixxx will feel unresponsive otherwise."

msgid "Sample Rate"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/chapters/configuration.rst:116
msgid "The sample rate setting in Mixxx determines how many samples per second are produced by Mixxx. Mixxx automatically selects a default sample rate for your soundcard, most likely 44100 Hz. In general, a higher sample rate means that Mixxx produces more audio data for your soundcard. This takes more CPU time, but in theory produces higher audio quality. On high-wattage club sound systems, it may become apparent if your audio sample rate is too low."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/chapters/configuration.rst:123
msgid "A sample rate of 96kHz takes Mixxx over twice as long to compute. Keep in mind that increasing the sample rate will increase CPU usage and likely raise the minimum latency you can achieve."

Your choice of Audio API can drastically affect Mixxx's performance on your computer. **Therefore it is important to take care to choose the best Audio API available to you.** Refer to the following table of Audio APIs to see what the best choice is for your operating system."
