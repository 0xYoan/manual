msgid "Vinyl control allows a user to manipulate the playback of a track in Mixxx using a real turntable as a controller. In effect, it simulates the sound and feel of having your digital music collection on vinyl. Many DJs prefer the tactile feel of vinyl, and vinyl control allows that feel to be preserved while retaining the benefits of using digital audio."

This is useful in situations where the time code begins very close to the edge of a vinyl which can make back-cueing over the first beat in a track tricky to do without your turntable's needle falling off the vinyl. Setting a lead-in time of 20 seconds or more helps alleviate this by giving you more room on the vinyl to cue with. It's also useful when you've worn the grooves at the edge of a control record to the point that it no longer works reliably: you simply set the lead-in so that the start of the tracks begin in good groove area. You can keep doing this until you run out of groove area, thereby decreasing your record replacement frequency."
