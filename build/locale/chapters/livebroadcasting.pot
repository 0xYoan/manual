A popular free streaming service is `Caster.fm <http://www.caster.fm>`_.

Mixxx as a streaming source does not need to run on the same computer as your streaming server. However, professional stations often run the streaming source on the same computer as the streaming server for stability and reliability reasons. Keep in mind that if want to stream audio to a significant number of listeners, you'll need enough bandwidth. Read the `Shoutcast documentation <http://wiki.winamp.com/wiki/SHOUTcast_Getting_Started_Guide>`_ or `Icecast documentation <http://www.icecast.org/docs.php>`_ for server setup instructions."
