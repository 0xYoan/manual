msgid "What is the intended outcome of the manual?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/manual_guidelines.rst:10
msgid "A user who doesn\\'t know Mixxx yet should be able to mix two tracks from its music library in the shortest possible time. Assuming he will be more motivated to explore the software and get creative."

msgid "(Future) characteristics of the Mixxx manual:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/manual_guidelines.rst:21
msgid "**User-friendly**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/manual_guidelines.rst:17
msgid "Easy to use when, where, and how you need it. Examine, how someone else is using the application. Watch someone else use the manual (preferably someone who has never seen it before). Be consistent with the instructional design so users can follow a set pattern. Don't use the terms you use as a developer, try to find the terminology of the user."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/manual_guidelines.rst:27
msgid "**Based on sound learning principles**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/manual_guidelines.rst:24
msgid "For example users should actually learn from it, not just refer to it. Use the KISS principle; keep it sweet and simple. Too much information can be overwhelming, so present one concept at a time. Explain simple features in a matrix."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/manual_guidelines.rst:31
msgid "**Motivational**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/manual_guidelines.rst:30
msgid "Keeps users willing to push forward to higher levels. Present general concepts first to provide a frame of reference. Then move to more complex topics."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/manual_guidelines.rst:33
msgid "Group problems the user might hit in a particular task right there with the instruction for that task. Do not force a user to go to a separate “Troubleshooting” section. We can have such separate sections, but as a author you should duplicate pitfalls and problems and include a solution in the task."

msgid "Line Widths"

#: ../../source/manual_guidelines.rst:44
msgid "Please configure your editor to have a max column-width of 80-columns. While it is not a strict requirement, 80-column cleanliness makes it easy to tile multiple buffers of code across a laptop screen, which provides significant efficiency gains to developers."

msgid "Screenshots"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/manual_guidelines.rst:52
msgid "Use English language settings when creating screen-shots of the Mixxx interface. This might change if we ever have true `i18n <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization>`_. The preferred file format is PNG. **Don't add shadows** to application window screen-shots as they are added automatically to the document with style-sheets."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/manual_guidelines.rst:58
msgid "Always include descriptive alt text and a figure description. The latter will be numbered in the PDF export. That sets them apart from the text below. Place screen-shots above the context you are going to explain."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/manual_guidelines.rst:62
msgid "Screenshots should only show the necessary area and not the entire screen where not necessary. Use annotation on the screenshot if necessary to emphasize elements, use color ``#FF1F90`` if possible for consistency."

msgid "File naming"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/manual_guidelines.rst:93
msgid "As the manual grows over the time with new versions of Mixxx and new screenshots, it is important to have files named consistently. Save files to the :file:`/static` folder or create a sub-folder in there."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/manual_guidelines.rst:101
